# Python for Data Science
This directory contains my notes in the form of practice codes (.ipynb notebooks) of all the major libraries that are extensively used by Data Scientists. Including Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, etc

### NumPy
NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. NumPy is extremely important to understan as many libraries in the Data Science Ecosystem (like pandas) is based on the numpy arrays and NumPy is their main building block.

NumPy is extremely fast when it comes to handling huge volumnes of data.</br>

In the NumPy notebook I have focused on Numpy Arrays, their Indexing and Slicing and on their Operation.

### Pandas
Pandas is arguably the most important python library for Data Science. It does all the heavy lifting for data procurement, data exploration and data manipulation. It is vast and encompasses almost all functions that one can think of for data handling. Pandas is extremely quick even when handling extremely huge data volume.

To understand pandas comprehensively, I have divided them into 8 major notebooks each focusing on somthing specific. The notebooks are - 
1. [Pandas Series](Pandas%20-%201.%20Series.ipynb)
2. [DataFrame Introduction](Pandas%20-%202.%20DataFrames%20Introduction.ipynb)
3. [Selection and Indexing](Pandas%20-%203.%20Selection%20and%20Indexing.ipynb)
4. [Altering DataFrames](Pandas%20-%204.%20Altering%20DataFrames.ipynb)
5. [Analysing and Dealing with Missing Data](Pandas%20-%205.%20Missing%20Data.ipynb)
6. [Data Gathering (Input,Output,Mearging,Joining,Concatanating)](Pandas%20-%206.%20Data%20Gathering%20(Input%2C%20Output%2C%20Concatenating%2C%20Merging%2C%20Joining).ipynb)
7. [GroupBy and Apply](Pandas%20-%207.%20GroupBy%20and%20Apply.ipynb)
8. [Basic Data Exploration](Pandas%20-%208.%20Basic%20DataExploration.ipynb)

These 8 notebooks have alomost everything that might be required to deal with Data. These notebooks are however not exhaustive and only pandas documentation can be considered to as close to exhaustive.

### MatPlotLib
MatPlotLib is a data visualisation library. Like NumPy is the fundamental library on which many others are built similarly, Matplotlib is the fundamental data visualisation library on which many others are built. Matplotlib provides the most customisation options than any other library and contains functions to make almost every kind of plot that is possible.

### Seaborn
Seaborn is also a data visualisation library. It is built on MatPlotLib and the plots made using Seaborn are easy to tailor and comparitively prettier to look at.
