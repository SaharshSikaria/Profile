# SQL Case Study

This directory contains some case studies for implementing a working RDBMS for a business.

Each of the cases contains at least the following steps
1. Modeling the Database
2. Making the ER diagram for the database
3. Using DDL statements to difine the Database and also establishing relationships using keys
4. Importing the data into the database
5. Making many queries to solve business inquiries

I have also given a narration to the case just to make it more relateable. Read the Readme file for the narrative. 

## Case 1 - [Toy Story]()
This case is based on a business which creates toy replicas and sells them as a wholesalers.
