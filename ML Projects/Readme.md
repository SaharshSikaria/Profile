## Linear Regression Project
*Dataset Used - Housing Data From Kaggle*

I have implemented it in two forms.
1. [Linear Regrassion implementation as a Project(.ipynb)](Linear%20Regression%20-%20Housing%20Prices.ipynb)
2. [Linear Regression implementaiton using a Data Pipeline(.ipynb)](Linear%20Regression%20-%20Data%20Pipeline%20Implementation%20-%20Housing%20Data%20Project%20.ipynb)

**They both have their respective benefits.**

The **Project approach** gives alot of scope for easy customisation and manipulation of data. It should be used when we are doing the first analysis on a dataset. As, we can analyse data at every step very easily.

The **Data Pipeline approach** makes the code much cleaner, leaves scope for fewer bugs and is eventually much easier to productionize. We can even create custom function for data modeling like in the first approach. 

**About the Project**

## Logistic Regression Project
*Dataset Used - Advertisement data of a company website*

[Logistic Regression Implementation](Logistic%20Regression%20Project.ipynb)

**About The Project**

In this Project, we take the user log of a website along with the marker if they clicked on a particular Advertisement or not. With the help of a Logistic Regression model, we will try to predict whether or not they will click on an Ad based off the features of that user and of that advertisement. 
```
Following steps have been impleted in this project
1. Loading and inspecting the Dataset
2. Performing Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Feature Analysis and Identification for the model
4. Building the model
5. Error Evaluation
```
