# Machine Learning Projects
## Linear Regression Project
*Dataset Used - Housing Data From Kaggle*

I have implemented it in two forms.
1. [Linear Regrassion implementation as a Project](Linear%20Regression%20-%20Housing%20Prices.ipynb)
2. [Linear Regression implementaiton Using a Data Pipeline](Linear%20Regression%20-%20Data%20Pipeline%20Implementation%20-%20Housing%20Data%20Project%20.ipynb)

**They both have their respective benefits.**

The **Project approach** gives alot of scope for easy customisation and manipulation of data. It should be used when we are doing the first analysis on a dataset. As, we can analyse data at every step very easily.

The **Data Pipeline approach** makes the code much cleaner, leaves scope for fewer bugs and is eventually much easier to productionize. We can even create custom function for data modeling like in the first approach.
