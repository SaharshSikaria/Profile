Welcome to my Profie!
This Repository contains many projects that I have built in the last 4 months. The sole purpose of this repository is to showcase my understanding of various concepts of Data Science, Data Analytics and Machine Learning

*Declaration - Every Line of Code or theory that is contained in ths repository is written by me and not copy pasted from anywhere. I have however taken refrences from the various courses that I have done.*

For Python I have made two directories.
1. [Basics of Python](Python%20Basics)
2. [Python for Data Science](Python%20for%20Data%20Science)

### [Basics of Python](Python%20Basics)
This directory covers my understanding of Python as a language in the form of my notes that I keep regularly updating for my refrence

### [Python for Data Science](Python%20for%20Data%20Science)
This directory contains my knowledge in the form of practice codes of all the major libraries that are extensively used by Data Scientists. Including Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, etc

The SQL directory is divided into two parts
1. [Theory](SQL/Theory)
2. [Case Studies](SQL/Case%20Study)

### [Theory](SQL/Theory)
This section contains my notes on SQL. They contains notes on Sql Scripts as well as the theory of SQL.

### [Case Studies](SQL/Case%20Study)
The case studies are to showcase my application capability of the SQL Theory. In many of them I have given them a narative of a story aligning them with a business use-case for a company.

The [Advance Excel directory](Advance%20Excel) contains various case studies that I have conducted using MS-Excel. Every Case is further placed in a respective directory. In each directory there is a separate readme file enlisting all the Excel methodologies/techniques that I have employed.

For Machnie Learning I have made two directories
1. [Theory of Machine Learning](ML%20Theory)
2. [Machine Learning Projects](ML%20Projects)

### [Machine Learning Theory](ML%20Theory)
This contains my notes on each of the Machine Learning Algorithm that I have studied. Each Algorithm is placed in a separate directory containing a readme file to navigate that directory easily. Every directory contains 
1. Idea behind the algorithm 
2. Brief overview of the math behind the algorithm 
3. Popular evaluation parameters used for this particular kind of algorithm.
4. Things to keep in mind while using the algorithm

Along with theory, there are also a ipynb file that has a basic implementation on a easy dataset without much effort. The purpose of this implementation is just for refrence.

### [Machine Learning Projects](ML%20Theory)
This contains the Jupyter Notebook files for various Projects that I have done as a part of my learning Experience. I hve tried making projects for every Machine Learning Algorithm. I mean to say, that for every Machine Learning Algorithm, I took up a relevant data set and applied the algorithm. With this approach you will be able to see my understandig of every Algorithm. Plus, you will be also able to judge my understanding if the nitty-gritties of the particular Algorithm.

In every project I have tried to demonstrate a parallel technique of machine learning along with the algorithm. By parallel technique, I mean techniques such as HyperParameter Tuning, Data Normalisation, Overfitting and Underfitting, Establishment of Data Pipelines, etc.

The Jupyter Notebook for Every Project is very detailed and I have given the project overview in the readme file of the directory itself.
