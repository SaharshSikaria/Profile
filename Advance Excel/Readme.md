3. **Filtering the Data** - Filtered the data by customer segment and created 4 new woorksheet one for each customer segment.
4. **Freezing the Header Row** - Using the **Freeze Panes function in View Tab**.
5. **Rounding off** - Sales and profit column to one decimal place
6. **Changing Data Types Units** - Converted Sales and profit column units to US Dollar. Order Date and Ship Date to Dates.
7. **Sorting** - Performed Custom Sort on three levels. First level of sort by Region (alphabetically), second level of sort by Province (alphabetically) and final level of sork by sales (decending order).
8. **Conditional Formatting** - Within every Region, highlighted the top 10% orders by sales in light green fill and dark green border. Secondly, higllited the profits by green and losses by red.
